# Typography

Typography is used to create clear hierarchy throughout the layout. It is the core structure of well designed interfaces.  
When type scaling is used appropriately it creates intentional flows, user focus, and progressive emphasis.

## Typeface

```render
<Typography typeface="System" />
```
## Examples

```render
<ExampleCode>
  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <p>Body copy</p>
</ExampleCode>
```
```
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<p>Body copy</p>
```
