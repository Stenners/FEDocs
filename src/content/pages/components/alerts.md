# Alerts
Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.

### Examples
Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button. For proper styling, use one of the four required contextual classes (e.g., .alert-success). For inline dismissal, use the alerts jQuery plugin.

```render
<ExampleCode>
  <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    This is a primary alert—check it out!
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    This is a secondary alert—check it out!
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
    This is a success alert—check it out!
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    This is a danger alert—check it out!
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    This is a warning alert—check it out!
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    This is a info alert—check it out!
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
    This is a light alert—check it out!
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
    This is a dark alert—check it out!
  </div>
</ExampleCode>
```
